	<h1>Weimar Republic</h1>
	
	<h3>In 1923 a hyper-inflationary period strikes Germany:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Explain two reasons as to why this terrible inflation begins in Germany.<p>The main cause of the German hyperinflation in 1923 was World War I. The country had abandoned the gold backing of its currency in 1914 <a href="#citation">(Goodman)</a> and resorted to financing its war efforts with international loans. Everyone expected the war to be short, but after four long years of fighting, Germany lost and had a mountain of debt to repay. Beyond the costs of the war, Germany’s economy was also hindered by reparation payments and the loss of mines in the Saar region. In order to pay back its debts, Germany began printing money and taking out even more loans. This made the economy extremely unstable and significantly devalued the mark.</p>
			<p>Another cause of the high inflation was the unstable government. Leadership in the newly formed republic was fragile and led to some poor decisions. Firstly, many German economists claimed that the amount of money in circulation was not excessive <a href="#citation">(Goodman)</a>. The government did not attempt to lower inflation since it hoped that a less valuable currency would lead to more exports. They clearly did not appreciate just how much the inflation would spiral over time. The French army also enforced payment by occupying the Ruhr. The Germans had no choice but to divert attention from fixing the economy to paying their reparations. Beyond this, the German government feared that interfering in the economy would lead to higher unemployment. It was concerned that taking away jobs could spark a communist revolution.</p></li>
			<li>In a number of paragraphs explain three consequences of this inflationary period in Germany in 1923.<p>One major consequence of hyperinflation was that years of investments were soon worth almost nothing. Many people who chose to invest and save their money had years of their hard work transformed into pocket change. In 1914, one American Dollar was worth around four or five marks. By 1923, one Dollar was worth over one trillion marks. The price of consumables and the cost of living surged. One wheelbarrow full of the German currency was needed to purchase a newspaper or a loaf of bread.</p>
			<p>Another result was that Germans lost faith in their country. When inflation first began rising, most people believed that it could be corrected. After the assassination of foreign minister Walter Rathenau, all trust in paper currency was lost. Citizens began exchanging currency for more stable items such as gold, diamonds, and real estate. Valuable items including pianos “were bought even by unmusical families” <a href="#citation">(Goodman)</a>.</p>
			<p>A third consequence of the inflation was that people became reckless with money. As the mark became increasingly more useless, Germans could no longer invest their money in valuables such as gold. Since the mark became worthless, Germans had to invest their money in cheap consumables. The value of money was lost and the general practice of saving it up was no longer applicable. People began wasting their savings on luxuries and cocaine. The bartering system also began to replace currency. With the period of hyperinflation, the law began to crumble as well. Many resorted to stealing commodities like copper and brass and to siphoning gasoline from cars.</p></li>
			<li>The Dawes Plan of 1924 stabilizes the inflationary period throughout Europe. Explain three consequences of this plan.<p>The main consequence of the Dawes Plan for the allies was that it slowed down Germany’s payment of reparations. After Germany defaulted payment in January 1923, Charles Dawes led a committee that attempted to find a suitable solution. A combination of the French occupation of the Ruhr, inflation, and the loss of coal mines in the Saar led to economic instability. A plan of reduced payments that would increase over time as the economy improved was set up to make the payments feasible for Germany. Although the plan led to an improved German economy, it was a consequence for the short-term best interest of countries collecting reparations.</p>
			<p>The main undesired result of the Dawes Plan was that it made Europe dependent on the American economy. Seventeen European nations had already borrowed money from the US during the war and the plan just made debt to America even worse. Soon after agreeing to the plan, the US gave money to Germany, which it used to pay its reparations to France and Britain. The money those nations received from Germany was then used to pay off American loans <a href="#citation">(Office of the Historian)</a>. America was just cycling its money and hoping that the German economy would eventually improve. This made the allies indirectly dependent on America for their reparation payments. Germany’s debt to the US also grew and it became tied to the US Dollar. Future economic problems in America such as the Great Depression would also affect Germany.</p>
			<p>Another problem with the plan from the allies’ perspective is that the French army was expelled from the Ruhr. While the French occupied the area from 1923 to 1925, they took money directly from German industries to substitute the reparation payments that Germany refused to make after 1923. The workers responded by going on strike. Their resistance was one of the main reasons for the creation of the Dawes Plan that finally forced France to leave. Once the French left, the main consequence was that Germany succeeded in violating the Treaty of Versailles for the first time. The refusal to pay the full amount of reparations gave rise to many right-wing parties that began using nationalism to advocate anti-Versailles sentiments. Although the Nazis eventually rose to power, the idea of being able to defy the Treaty was likely in the back of Hitler’s mind when he announced he would ignore the agreement on disarmament.</p></li>

	<h3>Explain the event referred to as The Munich Putch of 1923.</h3>
		<p>The Munich Putsch was a coup attempted by Hitler and the Nazi Party on November 8th, 1923. The term putsch is defined as a violent attempt to overthrow government. It was well planned at a time when the Nazis had over fifty thousand members. Hitler tried to mimic Mussolini's march on Rome by beginning his revolt in Munich with the goal of marching to Berlin. The event is sometimes called the Beer Hall Putsch because it began in the Bürgerbräukeller beer hall. Hitler “fired his pistol into the ceiling” and “declared that the 'national revolution' had begun” <a href="#citation">(Holocaust Encyclopedia)</a>. The coup did not ignite a revolution due to poor execution and leadership. The Nazis failed to secure many of their targets including government offices and communication stations which allowed the police to call for reinforcements. Hitler also delayed ordering the march on Berlin which gave authorities additional time to organize themselves. The leaders of the uprising were captured and thrown in jail. Hitler was found guilty of high treason and sentenced to five years in a comfortable minimum security prison from where he was released after only eight months.</p>
	<h3>While Adolf Hitler is in prison he writes a book referred to as <em>Mein Kampf</em>. Not many people read his ramblings at this time. List four of  his bizarre statements which were made in <em>Mein Kampf</em>.</h3>
		<p><em>Mein Kampf</em> translates to <em>My Struggle</em>. The book was drafted by Hitler while he was in prison for his role in the Beer Hall Putsch. It was a poorly written and repetitive book that combined Hitler’s autobiography with his political ideas. Hitler’s literature was not as effective as his speeches. It was also inaccurate and intended to “provide a positive image of Hitler” <a href="#citation">(Simkin)</a>.</p>
		<p>“And so I believe today that my conduct is in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator. In standing guard against the Jew I am defending the handiwork of the Lord.” In this quote Hitler expresses his philosophy that all Germans belong to a superior Aryan race. He believed that Germans were created to rule the world and that they had the right to take land away from inferior races.</p>
		<p>“The Jew trafficked in the freedom of the nation and sold our country to the masters of international high finance.” In this passage Hitler is blaming Jews for Germany’s economic problems. He also strongly believed that Jewish leaders were working with communists to overthrow the government. Hitler hated Marxism and said that the communist Soviet Union was obstructing German expansion.</p>
		<p>Hitler’s book was also inspired by his belief that the Jewish community was conspiring to take over the world. This idea came to him after reading The International Jew by Henry Ford while he was in prison. A similar ideology was also published in Russia in 1903. According to Simkin, this ridiculous belief “played an important role in persuading fascists to seek the massacre of the Jewish people.”</p>
		<p>Lastly, a quote from Mein Kampf that perfectly demonstrates Hitler’s anti-Semitism is “the personification of the devil as the symbol of all evil assumes the living shape of the Jew.” Hatred of Jews is a reoccurring theme in Mein Kampf and this quote fully exposes Hitler’s racism.</p>
	<h3>Describe the political party which Hitler begins to lead in 1920.</h3>
		<p>In 1921, Hitler gained control of the National Socialist German Workers' Party that became known as the Nazi Party. During Hitler’s stay in Austria, he grew very anti-Semitic and transferred his beliefs to the party. He believed that Germany had been stabbed in the back during the Treaty of Versailles. According to Hitler, the Jews and the Socialists were “responsible for all the terms of the Treaty of Versailles” <a href="#citation">(Brown)</a>. When Hitler first took control of the party, it had only six thousand members. As support for the Weimar Republic lessened due to inflation and the French occupation of the Ruhr, extreme nationalists were inspired by Hitler. The Nazi Party quickly grew to over fifty thousand members by 1923.</p>
	<h3>Explain why thousands of people flocked to the Nazis Party during the depression.</h3>
		<p>The main reason why masses of Germans supported the Nazi Party was because of Hitler’s abilities as a politician. He was a great speaker and managed to rally followers with his personality. He gave very emotional speeches that often attacked the treaty of Versailles triggering a sense of nationalism among the German people. Hitler especially inspired the younger population that believed he could increase Germany’s global influence though militarism.</p>
		<p>Another reason why many German citizens supported the Nazis was because they feared communism. They thought that Hitler’s party was the only one that could prevent a communist coup <a href="#citation">(Brown)</a> and therefore were more likely to agree to Hitler’s ideology. The Nazis also promised many benefits to workers. Many individuals in the middle class were sinking to a lower status in the hierarchy because of the poor economy and inflation. They were eager to support Hitler’s simple solutions to the problem.</p>
		<p>Another major reason why many flocked to the Nazi Party was due to desperation. Unemployment had risen to nearly eighteen percent by 1932 after being less than four percent in 1928. Many members of the lower class relied on their local Nazi headquarters that often provided free meals. Like the middle class, many of these people accepted Hitler just because of their desperation for economic stability.</p>
	<h3>Explain four important events which led to Hitler the Nazis Party taking control of Germany in 1934.</h3>
		<p>On January 30th, 1933, German President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler as chancellor of Germany. This event directly led to Hitler becoming the supreme ruler of Germany in only half a year. By that point the Nazis were already the largest party in the Reichstag. Since they did not have a majority at the time, this event allowed Hitler to continue gaining influence in the government.</p>
		<p>The second incident on the road to Hitler’s rise to being the Führer was the fire that engulfed the Reichstag building in February. It was almost certainly started by the Nazis, but it gave Hitler an excuse to call for an election. He accused the communists of starting the fire and used the lie as an opportunity to imprison many of his rival communist politicians. Hitler then used the false threat of a communist uprising to convince Hindenburg to issue orders that abolished freedom of speech and assembly.</p>
		<p>Hitler’s election was successful and the Nazi Party was elected to government with forty-four percent of the vote. Although the Nazis did not get a majority, they had enough seats to control the government sufficiently. By intimidating other parties with the SA <a href="#citation">(BBC)</a>, the Nazis pressured legislature to pass the Enabling Act in March. The new law gave Hitler virtually unlimited dictatorial power for four years.</p>
		<p>The first major thing that Hitler did with his new power was to establish a one-party state. He outlawed the Social Democratic Party and later forced smaller parties to disband. The Catholic Centre Party also disbanded after Hitler agreed to a Concordat with the Pope <a href="#citation">(Cummings)</a>. On July 14th, 1933, with no other remaining parties, Hitler passed a law that banned all other partisan organizations. This was an important part of Hitler’s creation of a fascist state and made sure that no one could easily remove the Nazis from power.</p>
	<h3>Explain the meaning of the term <em>Third Reich</em>.</h3>
		<p>The Third Reich refers to the third historic German empire. It is the successor to the Holy Roman Empire (800 to 1806) and the German Empire (1871 to 1918). The term <em>Reich</em> means empire or realm. When President Hindenburg died in the August of 1934, Hitler proclaimed himself the President and Chancellor of Germany. He began being called the Führer, the German word for leader. Just before this, people began referring to Germany as the Third Reich and had hopes of the empire lasting one thousand years like Hitler had predicted.</p>
	<h3>Explain five ways that Hitler and the Nazis Party begins to build a Totalitarian state in Germany in the 1930s.</h3>
		<p>After Hitler gained absolute power, he began establishing a totalitarian state not unlike the one created by Mussolini. Hitler primarily held on to his power with purges that were carried out by his secret police; the Gestapo. In June 1934, Hitler ordered a mass execution of political rivals and individuals suspected of being opposed to the Nazi state. Beyond this, the secret police also arrested anyone that spoke out against Nazi Germany.</p>
		<p>Another way that a totalitarian state was built was through militarism. The “German army took an oath of allegiance” <a href="#citation">(History.com)</a> to the Führer after the president died. Hitler managed to win the loyalty of his army officers by explaining his aggressive plans of expansion. With the backing of the army, he was in an ideal position.</p>
		<p>The Nazi Party also maintained the fascist state with the use of propaganda. It controlled Germany’s press and spread propaganda to its citizens through all of its resources. Joseph Goebbels, the minister of propaganda, was in charge of a radio campaign that glorified the state through music and speeches that would play regularly on radio stations.</p>
		<p>An important part of maintaining the totalitarian state was the indoctrination of children. Students were encouraged to join the Hitler Youth, an organization that taught discipline, obedience to the Führer, and patriotism. Young Germans willingly wore Hitler Youth badges and uniforms and acted like Hitler’s personal army. They even helped the Nazis burn Western books that Hitler had banned.</p>
		<p>The last part of the totalitarian state in Germany was the increasing state control of education and religion. All public schools were run by Nazis and taught students propaganda about the state. The Nazi Party forced most Roman Catholic private schools to close so that it could more easily control the education of youth. Although Protestant churches were allowed to operate, the Nazis tried their best to force the churches to publicly support pro-Nazism.</p>
	<h3>Explain what the Jewish Laws of 1933 and the Nuremberg Laws did to Jews in Germany.</h3>
		<p>After Hitler came to power, he did not attempt to hide his anti-Semitic views. As soon as the Nazis won the election in March 1933, Hitler expelled all Jews from government positions. Jewish citizens were also fired from teaching occupations at universities and were forbidden to study law and medicine.</p>
		<p>Jews were later deprived of their citizenship. They could no longer vote and began being dehumanized. All Jewish individuals had to register with the government and were legally required to wear a yellow Star of David on their clothing to identify themselves as Jewish. According to Berenbam, Jewish people were banned from flying the German flag.</p>
		<p>Marriages and relationships between Jews and non-Jews were also banned. Hitler considered Jewish people inferior to the Aryan race and did not believe in cultural diversity. A Jew was defined as someone with three or more Jewish grandparents. The classification of partially Jewish people was a little less clear.</p>
		<p>The new laws that demoted Jews were exacerbated in the 1938 riots. After a young Jewish individual murdered a German diplomat in Paris, Nazis organized anti-Jewish riots in various cities on November 10th. Many Jews were murdered and countless synagogues and Jewish shops were destroyed. Twenty thousand were arrested and sent to prison camps. This was just a glimpse of what was to follow.</p>
	<h3>Explain how Hitler plans to provide Germany with an economic recovery in the 1930s.</h3>
		<p>Hitler primarily promised economic improvement by lowering unemployment. He had numerous ideas of how to achieve this. One of them was to expand territorially so that Germany could become self-sufficient.</p>
		<p>Hitler also attempted to reduce unemployment by building infrastructure. With new building projects like housing, highways, and sports arenas, Hitler thought he would significantly lower unemployment.</p>
		<p>Another one of Hitler’s attempts to fix the economy was through rebuilding the military. He ignored the Treaty of Versailles and began the rearmament of the German military. This created thousands of employment opportunities in munitions factories that thrived off the large orders placed by the Nazi government.</p>
		<p>Another way that Hitler planned to fix Germany’s economy was by having more control over it. He would increase taxes to fund new infrastructure projects. Similarly to fascist Italy, Hitler also planned to control wages and prices on the market. The Nazis banned strikes and outlawed unions since they fought to drive wages up.</p>
		<p>Hitler also established the National Labour Front as a replacement for unions. The Nazi controlled organization had the illusion of protecting workers, but it was actually used to further glorify the importance of labour and hard work for the good of the state. Workers were given benefits in the form of inexpensive vacations to make up for lower wages.</p>
		<p>One of the more unique methods to improve the economy that Hitler used was a scheme on the working class. A government program attempted to get workers to save money for a Volkswagen Beetle using a system of weekly deductions <a href="#citation">(Trueman)</a>. Employees would contribute five marks a week into an account. After reaching 750 marks, which would take about three years, the workers could supposedly apply to receive their car. In reality no one actually got a car or a refund. The money that was invested by workers directly funded the weapons industry. Any complaints were dealt with by the secret police.</p>
	<h3>Explain Hitler's views on expansion and how was this to be done.</h3>
		<p>In <em>Mein Kampf</em>, Hitler insisted that the Aryan master race was destined to rule over other inferior societies. Hitler also sought expansion to improve national economic self-sufficiency and to generate what he referred to as living space. To achieve these goals, Nazi Germany would have to expand and conquer adjacent lands. The Slavs to the east of Germany were considered inferior which therefore gave Germany the right to invade and takeover their land. To complete his imperialistic objectives, Hitler recognized that he would need to rebuild the military. In 1935 he announced that Germany would be ignoring the Treaty of Versailles and began rearming the German forces. This not only grew the size of Germany’s army from 100,000 to 500,000, but it also significantly improved the economy since factories began making armaments again. Nazi Germany used the Soviet Union’s growing military and a need to defend itself as an excuse for the actions it had taken. Although the revival of Germany’s military was condemned by the League of Nations, no major action was taken. While France and the Soviet Union allied against Germany, Britain signed an agreement with the Nazis recognizing their right to build submarines. As Germany’s army grew to rival other European powers, Hitler could finally consider a move to expand German borders.</p>
