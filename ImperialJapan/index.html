	<h1>Imperial Japan</h1>
	
	<h3>Explain why the Government of Japan begins a period of aggression in the early 1930s in the Pacific region.</h3>
		<p>The primary reason why Japan shifted its focus to aggressive imperialism was due to the Great Depression. Japan’s industrialized economy depended heavily on foreign trade. Due to the recession, its exports were cut in half between 1929 and 1931. This is partly because demand for Japanese luxury exports such as silk decreased, but also because other nations introduced high tariffs on all foreign goods. This was done to protect domestic industries from cheaper foreign prices and it significantly hurt Japan’s economy and businesses. Unemployment rose drastically as a result. According to Townsend, “many Japanese believed that the structure of international peace embodied in the League of Nations favoured the western nations.” As a small island, Japan did not have sufficient access to crucial raw materials. Many leaders began adopting a policy of expansion because an acquisition of land would generate new resources and trade opportunities. Japan had already made Korea a protectorate and had gained some colonies from Germany after WWI. It then set its sights on the large coal supply in Manchuria in hopes of improving its economy.</p>
		<p>Another cause of Japan’s need for expansion came from its large population that was trapped on a small and densely crowded island. Japan’s population was still growing and its citizens could not emigrate. Many countries including the US, Australia, and Canada severely restricted Japanese immigration in a series of anti-Asian laws created in the 1920s based on racial prejudice. Japan was offended by this and saw expansion as the only solution to generate more living space and employment opportunities.</p>
		<p>A third cause of Japanese aggression in the 1930s was growing impatience with the government. Many groups criticized the parliamentary government of being unable to cope with the economic crisis. People stopped supporting the new democratic system because it was slow and often indecisive. Numerous nationalists and military officials were angry that their government was accepting the naval disarmament plan agreed on at the London Naval Conference in 1930. Prime Minister Yoko Hamaguchi agreed to keep Japan’s navy smaller than the navies of Great Britain and the US. Due to the government’s refusal to support imperialistic goals, multiple political leaders including Hamaguchi were assassinated which later led to a military takeover.</p>
	<h3>Describe three political reforms established in Japan in the 1920s.</h3>
		<p>The first new reform was a democratic government. After industrialization, a more educated middle class emerged that supported democratic developments. Most industrialists and businessmen agreed with the concept that was heavily based on government in Europe and in America.</p>
		<p>During the 1920s, the power of the emperor and the public’s unquestioned obedience to him also diminished. Political parties began gaining more power with the shift towards democratic elections. Previously, the prime minister was chosen by the emperor and held little power. After the 1920s, the party with the most votes had the power to appoint a prime minister. In this new system, the prime minister needed the support of an elected parliament to stay in power which limited the opportunity for authoritarianism.</p>
		<p>Another political reform was that the general population was given more rights. All men above the age of twenty-five obtained suffrage which increased the number of voters by nine million. This made the elected parliament more liable to the public’s demands. Japan also instituted a national health insurance plan and gave more lenience to workers and labour unions.</p>
	<h3>Explain two results of the London Naval Conference of 1930.</h3>
		<p>During the London Naval Conference in 1930, it was agreed that Japan would begin a process of disarmament. The “purpose of the meetings was to promote disarmament in the wake of the devastation of the First World War” <a href="#citation">(Office of the Historian)</a>, but it heavily favoured the western naval powers. The Japanese navy would have to remain smaller than the fleet of the US and Great Britain and “for every five capital ships the Americans and British had, the Japanese were allowed to have three” <a href="#citation">(Office of the Historian)</a>.</p>
		<p>Another important outcome of the agreement was that many Japanese military officials and nationalists were upset. The disarmament severely hurt their visions of a Japanese Empire. They did not agree with the government and saw the treaty as a sign of weakness and a concession to the west. Most admirals wanted to maintain a larger fleet in order to expand and claim Pacific islands to the south. The result of the London Naval Conference is one of the reasons for the military takeover of the government.</p>
	<h3>The Japanese military defies the civilian government of Japan and attacks Manchuria in 1931. Military leaders dominated the new state. Describe three features of the Japanese totalitarian state.</h3>
		<p>After the government’s failure to deal with the economy and its disarmament deal that was resented by military commanders, the Japanese army invaded Manchuria without the approval of the prime minister or the parliament. The military set up a totalitarian state in Japan primarily by controlling the government. After Hamaguchi resigned, the next prime minister was assassinated due to his disapproval of the military. Japan became a military dictatorship with the emperor left as a symbolic leader with no real power. The leadership was not controlled by one person, but rather was a group of army generals that dominated the government with their militaristic ideologies. The constitution was unchanged and unlike fascist Italy and Germany, political parties and members of parliament were not abolished. Life for civilians continued but the military had complete control over the government, especially military policy.</p>
		<p>The new totalitarian state also established censorship. A secret police was introduced that arrested all critics of the government and labelled them as “enemies of the state.” The government controlled and moderated the press while influencing the public with propaganda. It used the emperor as a puppet to gain more support. Nationalists also began glorifying war and the state similarly to what occurred in Italy.</p>
		<p>Beyond militarism, censorship, and an absolute government, the military also indoctrinated its population by controlling education. The new government fired all liberal professors from universities. Children were also taught obedience to the emperor and the state in schools.</p>
	<h3>Explain the world's reaction to Japanese expansion into Manchuria.</h3>
		<p>After the invasion of Manchuria, Japanese forces crushed the resistance from local Chinese troops. Japan claimed the territory and set up the country of Manchukuo, which was actually just a puppet state completely controlled by Japan. The Japanese heavily invested in the area’s infrastructure and hoped to maintain coal mining for the long-term future. China reacted to the invasion by protesting to the League of Nations. The league condemned Japan’s actions but took no further action. It refused to act just like it had done when Germany remilitarized the Rhineland and when Italy conquered Ethiopia. The League of Nations was distracted by the Great Depression and could not finance an intervention. Japan withdrew from the league in 1933. Locally, Japan was viewed as a leader of those opposed to western governments. It allied itself with other totalitarian states and signed a military alliance with Nazi Germany in 1936. Just like so many times before, the world remained mostly passive until the beginning of World War II.</p>
	<h3>Explain in a short paragraph what happens in Nanking in 1937.</h3>
		<p>From 1937 to 1945, Japan was at war with China in the Second Sino-Japanese War. A “minor engagement between Chinese and Japanese troops at the Marco-Polo Bridge, near Peking, led to undeclared war between the two nations” <a href="#citation">(Townsend)</a>. The Japanese army captured the Chinese city of Nanking and “embarked on a campaign of murder, rape and looting” <a href="#citation">(Townsend)</a> that was later called the Nanking Massacre. An estimated 250,000 to 300,000 people were killed, most of them civilian women and children. Some claim that as many as 20,000 women were raped during the sacking of the city. Many Japanese officials denied the accusations and claimed either that the scale of the massacre was inaccurate or that the story was a Chinese fabrication. The incident is still a source of tension between Japan and China today and is an example of the atrocities that can occur during a war.</p>
