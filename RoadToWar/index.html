	<h1>Road to War</h1>
	
	<h3>Briefly explain two important reasons for the start of the Spanish Civil War.</h3>
		<p>The first cause of the Spanish Civil War was political instability prior to the creation of a republic. In the early 1900s, many labourers went on strikes to protest various problems with the government. Some groups even sought independence from Spain. Others were simply unhappy with the large amount of power that the Catholic Church held within the country. Due to the growing pressure, the king abdicated in 1931. A republican government was then formed, which also failed to maintain order.</p>
		<p>The second cause of the Spanish Civil War was the ineffectiveness of the Second Spanish Republic. The Catholic Church lost its status as the official religion of Spain and much of its property was confiscated. Children no longer received mandatory Catholic education. The new government also reduced the size of the military. In turn, the republic not only angered the Church, but also many of its military leaders. No one was happy; the socialist unions went on strike, the anti-Catholic rebelled against the Church, the Church denounced the authority of the government, and the monarchists wanted the return of the king. This instability led to the formation of the Popular Front coalition between the liberal, socialist, and communist parties after the 1933 elections resulted in an even more conservative government.</p>
	<h3>Describe the beliefs of the two opposing sides of the Spanish Civil War.</h3>
		<p>One of the main sides during the Spanish Civil War was the Republicans. They were loyal to the democratic government that ran the Spanish Republic. The Republicans gained power after the formation of the Popular Front; a coalition of the liberal, socialist, and communist parties. They defeated the conservatives in the 1936 elections and took control of the government. The Republicans defended the Spanish government during the civil war.</p>
		<p>The opposing party during the conflict was the Nationalists. They were a group of fascist rebels led by General Francisco Franco and were extremely unhappy with the Spanish Republic that was formed after the king’s abdication. The group was started by military officials, but it was also supported by conservatives, monarchists, Catholics, and fascists. The military generals that were being led by Franco staged a revolt against the republican government in 1936 which led to a civil war. The main goals of the Nationalists were to restore power to the Catholic Church, to destroy socialism and communism in Spain, and to create a fascist state.</p>
	<h3>Explain who Germany , Italy, and The Soviet Union support in the Spanish Civil War from 1936-1939.</h3>
		<p>During the Spanish Civil War, the League of Nations tried to maintain neutrality and to stop munitions from entering the country. Like usual, it was unsuccessful. Britain wanted to support the Republicans, but it also did not intervene. France similarly stayed out of the conflict fearing backlash from its socialist population. America continued its policy of isolation from Europe, so the only major countries that had influence on the conflict were Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union.</p>
		<p>Germany and Italy were fascist states, so they naturally supported the Nationalists who also wanted to create a similar state. Mussolini sent thousands of Italian troops to help reinforce the Nationalists. Both nations also gave weapons. Hitler’s largest contribution was sending German planes to bomb cities held by the Republicans. The German planes proved to be superior to the ones sent by Russia.</p>
		<p>The Soviet Union supported the Republican side during the war; sometimes called the Loyalist side. The Russians were the only large supplier of weapons that the Republicans had the support of. Stalin’s assistance was more disguised than Hitler and Mussolini’s because Russia had signed the Non-Intervention Agreement as a part of a League of Nations embargo. The Russians supplied planes, tanks, and artillery; as well as hundreds of military advisers.</p>
	<h3>Explain in a short paragraph the following events which are referred to as the policy of Appeasement:</h3>
		<p>Appeasement was a policy used by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain for dealing with Nazi Germany. Chamberlain made multiple concessions to Hitler with the hope of maintaining peace and preventing another war. Britain did not join the anti-German alliance with France and the Soviet Union in order to remain less hostile to keep future negotiations on the table. Britain was reluctant to enter another war after the huge losses it had conceded during WWI. This policy of pacifism was also used in France.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Anschluss<p>Anschluss is a term that refers to an alliance between Germany and Austria. It was banned after the Treaty of Versailles, but this was ignored by Hitler. In March 1938, threats of German hostility forced the Austrian chancellor to resign. A Nazi Party official immediately took control of the government and invited Hitler to send troops to “maintain order.” German troops marched into Austria and a day later the country joined Germany. Chamberlain still refused to take action.</p></li>
			<li>The Sudetenland<p>After taking Austria, Hitler next wanted to move into Czechoslovakia. He was not initially supported by his generals who thought they would lose if Hitler declared a war <a href="#citation">(Simkin)</a>. Hitler encouraged the German population in the Sudetenland, the part of Czechoslovakia bordering Germany, to ask for sovereignty, but they were denied. The Sudetenland was eventually transferred to Germany in the Munich Agreement.</p></li>
			<li>The Munich Agreement<p>The Munich Agreement was also a part of Chamberlain’s appeasement policy. To avoid a German invasion of Czechoslovakia, he convinced the nation to grant the Sudetenland an independent government as Hitler had wished. Hitler was unsatisfied and then demanded that the area be directly transferred to German rule. A conference between Britain, Germany, France, and Italy was later held in Munich to settle the dispute. During the Munich Agreement, Hitler promised to leave the rest of Czechoslovakia alone if he was granted permission to take the Sudetenland. His victory at the conference encouraged Hitler to break the agreement and six months later he invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia.</p></li>
		</ol>
	<h3>Explain in a short paragraph who the following individuals were on the world scene from 1938-1939:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Neville Chamberlain<p>Neville Chamberlain was the Prime Minister of Britain from 1937 to 1940. He is well known for his policy of appeasement toward Germany. Chamberlain believed that by making concessions, he could avoid another war. He refused to join the Spanish Civil War and later continued his pacifism by accepting the Munich Agreement which gave the Sudetenland to Germany. His poor leadership during and preceding the war led to his forced resignation on May 10, 1940. He died of cancer soon after <a href="#citation">(Gov.uk)</a>.</p></li>
			<li>Winston Churchill<p>Winston Churchill was an inspirational figure and a very strong leader. He was one of the main reasons for Britain’s success in the war. Prior to the invasion of Poland, he had warned against the appeasement policy towards Germany. Churchill was chosen to succeed Chamberlain in 1940 and led a coalition government between multiple parties. He is famous for his ability to give great speeches that boosted morale, especially during the Battle of Britain. Churchill was surprisingly beaten by Clement Attlee in the 1945 election, but was re-elected in 1951 <a href="#citation">(Draper)</a>.</p></li>
			<li>Joseph Goebbels<p>Joseph Goebbels was an important member of the Nazi Party. He had built support for the Nazis between 1926 and 1930 just before Hitler rose to power <a href="#citation">(Trueman)</a>. Goebbels became Minister of Propaganda after Hitler was appointed chancellor in 1933. He held the position until he died in 1945. Goebbels was really good at his job and he understood the importance of controlling what people thought. He had a very close relationship with Hitler until the collapse of Berlin when he took his own life.</p></li>
			<li>Hermann Goering<p>Hermann Goering joined the Nazi Party in 1922. He was Hitler’s most loyal supporter <a href="#citation">(Fraenkel)</a> and was eventually given command of the SA. Goering also played a part in the Beer Hall Putsch. He was elected president of the Reichstag in 1932 and later on had a large role in the creation of the Gestapo and the first concentration camps.</p></li>
			<li>Edouard Daladier<p>Edouard Daladier was the French Prime Minster from 1938 to 1940 and was in power when France signed the Munich Agreement. Daladier was a supporter of appeasement but ultimately failed to lead France to a military victory. He resigned in March 1940 for his failure to sufficiently aid Finland in the Winter War.</p></li>
		</ol>
	<h3>Explain two reasons as to why the Nazi-Soviet Pact was signed in August of 1939.</h3>
		<p>One of the reasons why the Nazi-Soviet Pact was signed was because it was the better deal for Russia. Stalin knew that Hitler eventually wanted to attack Russia, so he first tried to form an alliance with Britain and France against Germany. The British feared Soviet communism and believed that the Russian army was too weak <a href="#citation">(Clare)</a>. Talks soon broke down and Russia left unable to trust Britain. Stalin knew that Germany would betray the nonaggression agreement, but the positives still outweighed the harms. The Nazi-Soviet Pact gave Russia half of Poland as well as future influence in the east. It delayed the inevitable attack while giving Russia some new territories.</p>
		<p>A second reason why the Nazi-Soviet Pact was signed was because it clearly benefited Germany. After breaking the Munich Agreement, Hitler knew that Britain and France no longer trusted him. This was later confirmed when Chamberlain announced that Britain would aid Poland if it were attacked. The French also agreed to support Poland and both nations began a process of rearmament. Although he hated communism, Hitler wanted to ensure that the Soviet Union would not interfere in an invasion. For security, the Nazi-Soviet Pact was announced. Beyond guaranteeing that the Soviets would not interfere in Poland, the nonaggression treaty also stated that Eastern Europe would be divided evenly between Germany and Russia once it was taken. The Nazi-Soviet Pact gave Germany confidence that it could attack Poland successfully.</p>
	<h3>Explain why Germany invades Poland September 1st 1939.</h3>
		<p>The main reason why Germany invaded Poland was because of imperialism. The invasion was a part of Hitler's plan to expand and to gain lebensraum; living space <a href="#citation">(History.com)</a>. It was also justified with Hitler’s argument that the German Aryan race was superior to the native Slavs that lived in Poland, which therefore gave Germany a claim on the land like he had promised in Mein Kampf. The invasion of Poland was a logical continuation to the annexation of Austria and the occupation of Czechoslovakia. Hitler hoped Britain and France would tolerate the attack just like they had with the previous two, especially since he was expanding away from Britain and France.</p>
		<p>A second reason for the invasion of Poland in 1939 was the existence of the Nazi-Soviet Pact. Germany knew that it had Russia on its side. After Soviet negotiations with Britain had failed, Russia had no other choice but to accept the pact hoping that it would delay an inevitable attack. Hitler agreed to divide Poland with Russia as long as he knew the Soviets would not defend Poland. Once Hitler found out about Poland's agreement with Britain and France, he tried to make propaganda “alleging persecution of German-speakers in eastern Poland” <a href="#citation">(History.com)</a> as an excuse for the invasion. He also faked a Polish invasion of Germany. Germany once again assumed it could get away with further aggressive expansion without Britain's interference being too significant. Hitler believed Chamberlain would continue his policy of appeasement and had no legitimate concerns of a consequence once he had Stalin on his side.</p>
	<h3>Explain in a paragraph for each, five significant events that take place in World War II from September 1st, 1939 until October 14th, 1940.</h3>
		<p>The first significant event in this time period was the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939. It represents the official start of WWII and the first time that Germany used its new tactic of blitzkrieg, a word meaning “lightning war” in German. The rapid attack occurred with all sections of the military and was aimed to break Polish defenses quickly and overwhelm smaller groups of defenders. The Germans destroyed the Polish airforce before it could take off. Poland was forced to surrender on September 27 before British and French troops could reinforce the Poles. Germany occupied the west side of the country, while the Soviet Union took the east.</p>
		<p>The Winter War occurred between the Soviet Union and Finland. Stalin expected that Germany would break its nonaggression pact soon after it acquired Poland, so he began building defenses on the front line. Russia annexed Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in 1940 and began fortifying the territories. Finland refused to allow Russian troops in its territory, so the Soviets launched the Winter War in November 1939. The Finns surrendered in March of next year and were forced to give up strategic locations to Russia. The poor performance of the Red Army in the war gave Hitler confidence that he could take Russia in a future invasion.</p>
		<p>Some of the most significant events during this time were the German victories on the Western Front. After taking Poland, the German army did not do anything significant for seven months. Finally it launched a blitzkrieg against Denmark and Norway. The Danes surrendered immediately while Norway's resistance took one month to break. Luxemburg and Belgium were taken soon after in a similar manner. Britain and France failed to defend Belgium, mainly because France had anticipated an attack on its direct front lines with Germany. By going through Belgium, the Germans managed to push back the French to the Dunkirk close to the English Channel. Over 160,000 British and French troops were evacuated to England with various military and commercial boats. Italy then invaded southern France and on June 16, the Germans marched into Paris. France asked for an armistice and surrendered on June 22. Germany took control of the French government in the upper two thirds of France and created a puppet state named Vichy France in the southern third.</p>
		<p>In July 1940, Britain attacked and destroyed the French navy at Mers-el-Kebir <a href="#citation">(Trueman)</a> in an assault named Operation Catapult. After France had surrendered, Britain wanted to ensure that French fleets did not fall into the hands of Germany. At the time that Germany’s naval peace terms were given to France, most French ships were docked in African bases. Germany’s terms of the surrender initially stated that France had to sail its ships back to French ports where they would be disarmed. The British were fearful that Germany would instead use the French ships in their own navy. Eventually Germany conceded and agreed to allow France to disarm its ships in their current African ports, but the British were not made aware of this agreement. The British Royal Navy was sent to the port at Mers el Kebir where it presented the French commanding admiral four options to avoid a battle. The terms were refused and Britain, fearful of French reinforcements being sent, opened fire on the French navy. Since France had little maneuverability within the port, Britain was very successful and managed to sink the majority of French ships. Although the ships never ended up in the hands of Germany, French-British relations were severely damaged. Even though the two nations had been allies just a few months ago at Dunkirk, the British killed over one thousand French soldiers during the bombardment.</p>
		<p>The Battle of Britain was a turning point for the British in the war. After the French surrendered, Britain had no allies left. Everyone expected a German invasion of mainland Britain and people were preparing to defend their last front. Neville Chamberlain was forced to resign after his unsuccessful appeasement policy and Winston Churchill became the new prime minister. He was very inspirational and vowed to defend Britain at all costs. The Battle of Britain began as a German bombardment campaign which lasted three months. Britain won the battle thanks to its Royal Air Force that defended against German bombers fairly successfully. The air force was significantly aided by the invention of the radar. The victory in the Battle of Britain strengthened British morale and led to Hitler cancelling the proposed invasion of Britain.</p>
