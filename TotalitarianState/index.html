	<h1>Totalitarian State</h1>
	
	<h3>Explain four characteristics of the Totalitarian State state.</h3>
		<p>The first characteristic of a totalitarian state is that it usually comes to power with a revolution <a href="#citation">(Bradley)</a>. It often overthrows the existing government by creating support from claims of benefiting the general public. An authoritarian state removes opposing political parties and individuals that publicize differing opinions. The state also controls public opinion by promising long-term improvements to support its actions.</p>
		<p>Another common theme in totalitarian states is idealism. The state claims that its revolutionary acts will lead to an ideal society. It wants to remove problems like corruption, poor economy, and poverty. Its ideology is often implemented in government, churches, and schools. The state uses fear and claims of utopian ideals to support its actions.</p>
		<p>Another frequent characteristic is intolerance. The state accepts no opposition or alternate views. Supporters of other ideologies are removed and zero criticism is tolerated. To support its ideas, the state controls the media. Communication is also censored and a one party system of government is often adopted.</p>
		<p>Lastly, totalitarian states emphasize state regulation of the economy. The state plans most economic decisions for the benefit of the nation as a whole. Any private enterprises are closely monitored. Economic growth is reported to the public in order to increase support for the state.</p>
	<h3>As a young child there was clear evidence that Benito Mussolini was an a odd individual. Explain three events from his early childhood that would be considered a bit bizarre.</h3>
		<p>Mussolini had a very bizarre childhood. He was disobedient and often acted like a bully. After the teachers at Mussolini’s local school could no longer control him, his parents sent him to boarding school. Once there he was soon expelled for stabbing one of the other students with a pocket knife <a href="#citation">(Foot)</a> and attacking one of the teachers that tried to beat him. At the next school he attended he again stabbed someone with his knife.</p>
		<p>Another odd event from Mussolini’s childhood was his misbehaviour at church. He acted mischievously and disruptively by pinching other attendees of the church <a href="#citation">(YouTube.com)</a>. He also allegedly threw stones at people outside of the building.</p>
		<p>A third strange part of Mussolini’s early childhood was his father indoctrinating him with a socialist ideology. His dedicated socialist father often took him to party meetings and taught him values while encouraging him to defy authority. To add to this, Mussolini was named after Benito Juarez, a Mexican revolutionary that eventually became president <a href="#citation">(YouTube.com)</a>.</p>
	<h3>Explain the origin of the term <em>Fascism</em>.</h3>
		<p>Fascism is derived from the ancient Roman word fasces. The term refers to a bundle of rods tied to an axe handle. During the Roman Empire, it symbolized strength through unity since a bundle of rods is harder to break than a single rod. This is symbolic since Mussolini tried to bring Italians together by using the glory of ancient Rome to inspire nationalism for the National Fascist Party.</p>
	<h3>If you were a Fascist, explain to me six policies you would follow and want me to understand.</h3>
		<p>Fascism is a political movement that is very opposed to socialism and communism. Fascists believe in private property that is regulated by the government and do not agree with the views of Karl Marx. Fascist governments like the one led by Mussolini often violently opposed socialists.</p>
		<p>Another main policy of fascism is that it is opposed to democracy, especially the parliamentary system. Believers of the ideology strongly support the idea that rivalries between political parties damage the unity of the state. Instead, fascists adopt a single-party system with one dependable ruler. They also believe that public elections are ineffective and are responsible for creating flawed ideologies such as Marxism.</p>
		<p>A common policy of fascism is extreme nationalism and imperialism. A good example is Mussolini, who believed in glorification of the state. He wanted to turn Italy into an empire resembling ancient Rome. His belief was that stronger states had the right to overtake weaker ones and that a desire for peace is a weakness. Fascist states often encourage the public to ignore human rights because domestic enemies of the system need to be punished.</p>
		<p>Another intriguing policy of fascism is how the economy is run. Although it is somewhat capitalistic in nature and has private ventures, the economy is indirectly controlled by the government <a href="#citation">(Richman)</a>. The state controls wages and requires owners of the means of production to use their property in the best interest of the state. Despite this, unlike communism, few industries are directly operated by the government.</p>
		<p>The use of censorship and propaganda is also prevalent in fascist states. Governments like the one run by Mussolini either owned the media or directly controlled it. Newspapers and other means of communication are censored from the public. Propaganda is included in schools similarly to how it was featured in Soviet Russia.</p>
		<p>Lastly, a common characteristic of fascism is the use of violence. Governments not only rise to power through revolution, but also use force to maintain their power. Opponents of the system are executed or sent to prison. Massive purges are also sometime used to control the public. Military sacrifice is glorified.</p>
	<h3>Explain four reasons why Fascism appeals to the people of Italy in the 1920s.</h3>
		<p>One reason why fascism appealed to the people of Italy in the twenties is its support of militarism. Many of the original supporters of the Fascist Party were war veterans that were disappointed with Italy’s result after World War I. Many of the lands Italy was promised in the Treaty of London were not actually gained and people desired territorial expansion.</p>
		<p>Nationalism is another cause for the support of fascism and is related to the last point. Many Italians wanted their country to conquer more territory. Mussolini used the idea of reviving the glory of the Roman Empire. He claimed he would make Italy a major global power once again.</p>
		<p>Another major reason why Mussolini was elected is because the people of Italy wanted a strong leader. They were impatient with the existing government and the huge debt it had created after the war. Italy's Chamber of Deputies was also unpaid and prone to corruption <a href="#citation">(SparkNotes.com)</a>. Italians were willing to accept a dictatorship as long as their leader was effective and could fix the economy.</p>
		<p>A fourth reason for the rise of fascism is the public support of its economic ideas. Mussolini was in favour of private enterprise and he developed his own corporative system. It featured employers and employees working together along with the state. The system attempted to resolve the class struggle with collaboration. The corporations would also control wages which benefited the working class.</p>
	<h3>Explain in a short paragraph how the Fascist Movement comes to power in Italy.</h3>
		<p>Fascism grew in Italy in the early twenties when Mussolini’s followers marched in the streets of multiple cities. Militias inspired by him attacked socialists and created chaos in Italy <a href="#citation">(Foot)</a>. The revolutionaries wore black clothing and were referred to as the “Black Shirts.” They ousted socialist government members and continued to grow support for fascism. In October of 1922, Mussolini announced the <em>March on Rome</em>. Protestors from all across the country began marching towards the capital city in an attempt to frighten the government to surrender. King Victor Emmanuel III chose not to use the military on the approaching crowds and instead named Mussolini prime minister a few days later.</p>
	<h3>Mussolini always considered himself a man of the people. But in reality he was not. Explain how he wants to be seen by the public of Italy.</h3>
		<p>Mussolini always spoke of himself as a “man of the people” <a href="#citation">(Foot)</a>. He wanted to be seen as a strong ruler that fixed Italy’s economy. He used propaganda and nationalism to make the public see him as a hero. Mussolini wanted to responsible for taking Italy’s power to a level comparable to the Roman Empire. In reality, Mussolini was a ruthless dictator. He controlled the public with censorship and propaganda that exaggerated his achievements. In an interview with British journalist Clare Sheridan, he privately stated that “the working classes are studid, dirty, lazy and only need the cinema” <a href="#citation">(Simkin)</a>.</p>
	<h3>Describe how the Fascist Party controlled Italy in the 1920s.</h3>
		<p>The main way that fascists established control over Italy was through their majority in parliament. After the revolution, Mussolini had emergency power for one year. He made a law that guaranteed a fascist majority before his influence expired. Although Italy remained a monarchy with an elected parliament, Mussolini had the right to initiate his own laws. Elections were eventually controlled with only one party to vote for. Fascists were also given the majority of important jobs in the government, military, and in the police.</p>
		<p>Censorship was also used to keep the fascists in control. Like in the Soviet Union, the government banned criticism of the state. The only accepted political view was fascism. Individuals opposed to fascism were either executed or sent to remote prisons.</p>
		<p>Another chief way that fascists held power over Italians was through propaganda. The government owned the leading Italian newspaper and often used it to praise Mussolini. Italians were expected to follow the motto of “Mussolini is always right.” Propaganda was also included in schools. Children were taught about fascism and wore black uniforms symbolic of the ideology. They were preached to about discipline, duty, and obedience; the three virtues that Mussolini believed were most crucial to the success of ancient Rome.</p>
	<h3>Explain why Italy invades Ethiopia in 1934.</h3>
		<p>The primary reason why Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935 was its foreign policy. Mussolini believed in imperialism and thought it was a good distraction from Italy’s economic problems. He was motivated by the success of ancient Rome and believed that Italy had a “right to an empire.” Italy had acquired some African colonies in the late 1800s and was anxious to expand its colonial influence in the area.</p>
		<p>The second reason for Italy’s intrusion is a small clash that occurred in 1934 on the border of Ethiopia and an Italian colony named Somaliland. Italy had previously tried to conquer Ethiopia in 1896 and resented its loss. The clash was an excuse for them to try again, now with much superior technology. Ethiopia appealed for help from the League of Nations but it just delayed its response and essentially looked away. Italy finally invaded in 1935 and easily outclassed the old-fashioned military of the African nation. The League of Nations later imposed some mild economic sanctions against Italy, but it intentionally left out oil so the sanctions would not cause a European conflict. Even those sanctions were dropped less than a year later.</p>
